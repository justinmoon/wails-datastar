- When I ask you to implement something a certain way, never attempt to hardcode a workaround that doesn't progress towards a real solution. sometimes hardcoding etc is fine if it moves us to a real solution, but way too often you do this just to get the concrete thing i asked you to do to seem to work -- but it's actually hard-coded and broken.
- Don't make defaults of variables or other things that will just add bugs.
